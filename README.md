# Turnabout - The best extension to prevent you from becoming tapped out

## Features
  - Live Mainboard Card Counts

More are coming! Tournabout is currently is super alpha.

## Using Turnabout
While Turnabout is still in alpha I'm not going to upload it to the chrome store. As a result 
the best way to use it is to download the zip through github and then install it directly following
these steps:

  1) Download the source from github
  2) Navigate to the chrome extensions tab [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
  3) Check the "Developer Mode" checkbox
  4) Click "Load Unpacked Extension" and select the source folder
  5) Go to [tappedout](tappedout.com) and enjoy!

# Turnabout - The best way to untap

## Features
  - Live Mainboard Card Counts

More are coming! Tournabout is currently is super alpha.

## Using Turnabout
While Turnabout is still in super alpha I'm not going to upload it to the chrome store or package it. As a result 
the best way to use it is to download the zip through github and then install it directly following these steps:

  1. Download the source from github
  2. Navigate to the chrome extensions tab [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
  3. Check the "Developer Mode" checkbox
  4. Click "Load Unpacked Extension" and select the source folder
  5. Go to [tappedout](tappedout.com) start editing and enjoy!

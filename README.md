# Turnabout - The best way to untap

## Features
  - Live Mainboard Card Counts

More are coming! Tournabout is currently is alpha.

## Using Turnabout
While Turnabout is still in alpha I'm not going to upload it to the chrome store. 
As a result the best way to use it is to download the .crx through github and drop
it into chrome:

  1. Download the packaged extension in the extension folder
  2. Open up chrome and drag/drop the downloaded crx into the window
  3. Go to [tappedout](tappedout.com) start editing and enjoy!
